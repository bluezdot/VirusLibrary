The envelope of HCV is similar to very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL).
[9] Because of this similarity, the virus is thought to be able to associate with apolipoproteins. 
It could surround itself with lipoproteins, partially covering up E1 and E2.
 Recent research indicates that these apolipoproteins interact with scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1).
