The outer coat of HIV, made up of two layers of lipids (fatty molecules).
    HIV uses protein "spikes" embedded in its envelope to enter host cells.
    Envelope proteins gp120 and gp41 bind to receptors on the surface of cells that HIV infects, and then penetrate the surface to infect it with the viral RNA.
    The spikes formed by these proteins are highly decorated with carbohydrates, making them difficult to recognize by antibodies.
    PDB entry 4nco includes SU and the portion of TM that is outside the membrane.
