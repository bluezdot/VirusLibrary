Hepatitis C virus has a positive sense single-stranded RNA genome. 
The genome consists of a single open reading frame that is 9,600 nucleotide bases long.
[14] This single open reading frame is translated to produce a single protein product, 
which is then further processed to produce smaller active proteins. 
This is why on publicly available databases, such as the European Bioinformatics Institute,
 the viral proteome only consists of 2 proteins.
