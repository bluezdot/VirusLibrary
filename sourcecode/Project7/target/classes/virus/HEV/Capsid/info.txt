The genome of HIV is composed of two identical strands of RNA, each about 9700 nucleotides long.
    The genome encodes the information needed to synthesize all of the viral proteins.
    Portions of the genome also form hairpin loops that interact with the regulatory proteins.
    Covered in spikes of the ‘glycoproteins’ gp120 and gp41, which allow HIV to lock onto the CD4 receptor on CD4 T cells and enter the cell.
