Capsid protein forms a cone-shaped coat around the viral RNA, delivering it into the cell during infection. It forms stable hexamers, which then assemble like tiles to form geodesic capsids.
    The capsid protein is able to form hexamers and pentamers by shifting slightly in structure.
    This is an example of the principle of "quasiequivalence", first proposed by Caspar and Klug in 1962.
    Quasiequivalence is the way that many viruses build capsids that are much larger than is possible with perfect symmetry, but that still only use a single type of protein chain.
    In the HIV capsid, the interactions between the many subunits are similar, but are deformed slightly to accommodate the different shapes of the cone-shaped portion and the round caps.
