HIV protease is essential for the maturation of HIV particles. 
The proteins in HIV are built as long polyproteins, which then must be cleaved into the proper functional pieces by HIV protease. 
Protease inhibitors are widely used as anti-HIV drugs, often in combination with drugs that block reverse transcriptase and integrase.
