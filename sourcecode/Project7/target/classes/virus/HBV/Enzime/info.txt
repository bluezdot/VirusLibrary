A molecule, usually a protein, that catalyzes (increases the rate of) chemical reactions in the body.
Enzymes are essential to all body functions.
HIV requires specific enzymes, such as reverse transcriptase or integrase, to replicate.
Reverse transcriptase builds a DNA copy of the viral RNA genome, which is then used to build new viruses.
This structure captures the enzyme as it is building a DNA strand (red) from the viral RNA (yellow).
It will then destroy the RNA and build a second DNA strand.
Many of the drugs currently used to fight HIV infection block the action of reverse transcriptase.
